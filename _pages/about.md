For as long as I can remember, I've known what I wanted to do in life. Reading Business has always been a passion of mine. Accounting and Mathematics, in particular, have interested me for some time. Dedicating my life to improving the lives of others is very appealing to me.

Forthrightly, I settled on a career capable of instructing and understanding human behaviour, Social Sciences and majored in Economics and Mathematics and later pinned down a speciality in Mathematical Sciences.

Now, I am an enterprising and initiative Mathematical Sciences graduate who want to lead, organise, train and develop, motivate and supervise others to achieve results in a business. Teachable, smart, go-getting, and eager to practically espouse theoretical concepts to increase productivity through quality work and paradigm shift and in remedying problems confronting humanity by making intriguing and crucial research in areas of interests.

Besides, Data Science has been a passion of mine since I became an Administrative Assistant where I was not only restricted to administrative duties but conducting research and analysing data using some statistical packages such as SPSS, STATA, and Excel. Forthrightly, I got the privilege to be part of the Blossom Academy Data Science Fellowship Programme in which I am specialising in Machine Learning Engineering.  I have acquired more knowledge in writing algorithms for numerous projects where recently we partake in the "Zindi" and "Kaggle" Challenge.

Sharp, focus, improvisation swiftness, teamwork conscience, multi-tasking ability, real-time fast-thinking towards remedying problems, disciplined, fast learning aptness are the listed attributes that have rendered me fruitful thus far. It was a fast learning curve for me in diverting from Economics and Mathematics to Mathematical Sciences in AIMS-Ghana and I am set to replicate these for exploits.
